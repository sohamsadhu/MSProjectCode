// Design of to be experiment.
// First hierarchy would be the folder with chaining value,
// The folder numbers would be 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024.
// Next in each of these folders would 4 attack algorithms. So each folder 
// would have hill climb, simulated annealing, taboo search, random selection.
// Each of these algorithm will have 4 digest sizes consisting of 224, 256, 384, 512.
// Each of the digest size will have 3 SHA-3 finalist algorithm folder.
// Each of the finalist algorithm folder will have 3 rounds folder to them.
// Each round folder will have 20 text files.
