// Design of to be experiment.
// First hierarchy would be the folder with chaining value,
// The folder numbers would be 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024.
// Next in each of these folders would 4 attack algorithms. So each folder 
// would have hill climb, simulated annealing, taboo search, random selection.
// Each of these algorithm will have 4 digest sizes consisting of 224, 256, 384, 512.
// Each of the digest size will have 3 SHA-3 finalist algorithm folder.
// Each of the finalist algorithm folder will have 3 rounds folder to them.
// Each round will have another 3 folder for start, middle and end. And each folder
// will have 20 files in them. So 51,840 files of data for me to handle.
// So the file will consist of number of success, number of failures, 
// average iteration for failure, success, and average iteration.
